### Hi there welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹!

Hello, my name is Heriberto Roman I am a non-traditional self-taught Software Engineer. I got my start in tech during my time with LatinosinHigherEd.com while working as a manager there I was exposed to the opportunity to work on some front-end tasks using HTML, CSS, and Javascript via the way of Dreamweaver. Iâ€™ve held a few positions in tech since then in different capacities.

Most recently I spent 1 year with Tiny Organics as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Tiny is an e-commerce platform that sells organic baby food we utilized Python and Django on the backend with React and Redux on the front end and I was part of a re-platform team.

The product at the time outgrew Shopify so there was a need to grow and customize the platform. I worked with 3 other engineers and an engineering manager to help build out new features. Aside from the re-platform team I was responsible for triaging incoming bugs reported by various stakeholders.

To date, I spend my time as a freelance software engineer and was recently selected for a competitive Fellowship program to work alongside software engineers from top companies to level up my engineering skillset and strengthen my CS fundamentals.

Moving forward I am looking for a role as a full-stack engineer that will allow me to make an impact and take ownership of the software.
